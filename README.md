# Camera2Api
A simple Camera App using Camera2 Api to capture images and take videos.

## Description
As clear from the screenshot, it takes images as well as videos, and one can also adjust the brightness of the image while capturing it. This app basically shows the least of the things we can do using the magical Camera2 API. 


## Issues
I am having some issues with proper optimization of the app, so if anyone is interested it making it somewhat better than what it is right now, maybe add some more adjustable features like contrast, exposure and all, or make it more efficient, or maybe anything else, feel free to leave a pull request.
